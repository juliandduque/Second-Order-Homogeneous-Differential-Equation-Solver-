# Second-Order-Homogeneous-Differential-Equation-Solver-

This is a very simple program to solve second order homogeneuos differential equation problems with constant coefficients in a fast and easy way. The application is written in C and it is based of Euler's method for solving differential equations using the quadratic theorem. 

Known bugs:
- The program does not check user input pattern, as the equation must be in a standard form highlighted in the program instructions.

What is next?
- Add complexity so it can solve a wider range of differential equation problems. 



Feel free to use it for your homework!
